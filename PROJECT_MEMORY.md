# Project Memory

Last updated: 2026-07-01

## Operating rule

- Whenever a future assistant makes changes, completes a task, or learns important project context, update this memory/documentation before finishing.
- Keep this file useful for handoff between Codex, Claude, or another assistant: record completed work, current progress, pending tasks, important decisions, and technical learnings.
- Do not overwrite unrelated user changes. If the worktree has existing untracked or modified files, preserve them unless the user explicitly asks otherwise.

## Current project status

- Project root: `sales-dashboard-live`.
- App: PULSE, an Amazon Seller Portfolio Sales Dashboard.
- Frontend: React + Vite in `sales-dashboard-live/src/App.jsx`.
- Backend: Vercel serverless function in `sales-dashboard-live/api/datadoe.js`.
- Data source: DataDoe REST API, using a server-side `DATADOE_API_KEY`.
- Deployment target: Vercel. Pushing code to GitHub should trigger Vercel rebuild/redeploy.
- Critical Vercel setting: Settings -> General -> Root Directory must be `sales-dashboard-live`, because the project files are nested one folder deep.
- Local development command from the README: `npm install`, then `npm run dev`.

## Completed

- Initial project files exist for the Vite frontend, Vercel API route, package metadata, and README.
- `node_modules` and `dist` are present under `sales-dashboard-live`, suggesting dependencies have been installed and a production build has been generated at least once.
- Added this project memory file so future work has a durable handoff location.
- Fixed a DataDoe sales export failure caused by sending more than 5 `sellerOrVendorIds` in one export request. `sales-dashboard-live/api/datadoe.js` now chunks sales exports into batches of 5 and combines the returned rows.
- Vercel deployment is intended to auto-deploy from the main branch.
- Local commit `Batch DataDoe sales exports` was created on `main`, but push from this environment was blocked because GitHub credentials were authenticated as `aibylk16` and the remote `LaxmiKant1604/Upriver-Dashboard` returned HTTP 403.
- `DATADOE_API_KEY` is expected to be configured for Production, Preview, and Development in Vercel.
- DataDoe authentication is verified to use the custom `datadoe-api-key` header, not standard Bearer auth.
- DataDoe endpoint paths are verified as `/util/sellers-and-vendors` for accounts and `/exports` for export creation/data retrieval.
- Account list loading has worked with 15 accounts visible in dropdowns.

## In progress

- No active implementation task is in progress.

## Pending tasks and known follow-ups

- Verify sales numbers on the live dashboard match Seller Central expectations.
- Consider switching sales source from `b24cd69c06` (Profit by Date, settlement-based, roughly 7-day lag) to `401ffcd7e5` (Sales & Traffic by ASIN & Date, roughly 4-day lag, closer to Seller Central) if accuracy is off.
- Add Profit module for net margin analysis.
- Add PPC module for ad spend, ACoS, TACoS, and campaign performance.
- Add Inventory module for FBA stock, days-of-cover, and restock alerts.
- Currency conversion currently uses static approximate FX rates in `src/App.jsx`; consider wiring in a live FX API or creating a maintenance process for updates.
- Brand grouping is inferred from account names and may need manual validation after first real-data deploy.
- Confirm whether MeridianMarKet / MeridianmarKet / MeridienMarket should merge as one brand; currently they may be treated separately because spelling differs.
- YoY comparisons require roughly 13 months of account history.
- The most recent 1-2 days of Amazon data may change as settlement data finalizes.
- README text currently displays mojibake for some punctuation in this environment; consider normalizing the file encoding if editing it later.

## Key decisions

- Source ID `b24cd69c06` was chosen initially for daily account-level rollup. Trade-off: it is settlement-based and can lag Seller Central by roughly 7 days. `401ffcd7e5` may match Seller Central more closely but has not been swapped in.
- Static FX rates are hardcoded in `src/App.jsx` for now. This is simple and free, but rates need periodic updates or a live API later.
- Brand grouping is heuristic: account names are grouped by stripping marketplace codes. This needs manual handling for spelling edge cases.
- Project files should remain under `sales-dashboard-live/` unless Vercel's Root Directory setting is changed too.

## Technical learnings

- The dashboard combines multiple Amazon accounts and supports account/brand selection, KPI cards, DoD/WoW/MTD/YoY comparisons, a sales trend chart, and account/brand breakdowns.
- The browser should never receive the DataDoe API key; all authenticated DataDoe requests go through the serverless API route.
- When running local dev, the Vite dev server proxies `/api` to `localhost:3000`, so `vercel dev` may be needed separately for API routes.
- DataDoe's export creation API rejects `sellerOrVendorIds` arrays with more than 5 elements. Any all-account, marketplace, or large-brand request must be batched server-side.
- `npm run build` currently succeeds, but Vite warns that the generated JS chunk is larger than 500 kB.
- DataDoe REST API rate limit is understood to be 2 requests/second per organization; excess requests may return HTTP 429 with `Retry-After: 1`.
- DataDoe exports are asynchronous: POST `/exports`, poll `/exports/{id}` until status is `COMPLETED`, then GET `/exports/{id}/raw`.
- DataDoe API keys are shown only once at creation time. After that, only the prefix is visible in the UI.
- Vercel serverless functions cannot have spaces in the filename. A file named `datadoe (1).js` under `api/` would fail deployment with `invalid_function_name`; the active API route must remain `api/datadoe.js`.
- Changing Vercel environment variables does not auto-redeploy. Trigger a redeploy for new values to take effect.

## Amazon accounts inventory

- 15 total accounts were previously observed through DataDoe.
- Marketplace count observed: IN (7), US (5), AU (1), CA (1), plus 1 US-marketplace account labelled "AU" in DataDoe data.
- Accounts with Amazon Ads connected: Indya Store IN, Haven&Hue US, JustHuman IN, Sashaa World IN, AAKRITI ART CREATIONS IN.
- Treat DataDoe's `/util/sellers-and-vendors` endpoint as authoritative for the current account list.

## How to resume cold

1. Read this file end to end.
2. Verify the live site works by hard-refreshing the Vercel deployment.
3. If it errors, read the on-screen error message; the app surfaces DataDoe errors verbatim.
4. Make code changes under `sales-dashboard-live/`, then commit and push.
5. Vercel should auto-deploy from the main branch.
6. If `git push origin main` returns 403, update the GitHub credentials or remote access for `LaxmiKant1604/Upriver-Dashboard`, then push again.
7. Update this file whenever a task is completed, new context is learned, or an important decision is made.
